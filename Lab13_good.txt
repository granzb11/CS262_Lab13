 You are to create a (very) simple word processor.
 Your program will prompt the user to enter the name
 of an input file containing text ("Lab13_bad.txt").
 It will then prompt you for the name of an output file.
 Your program will open the input file for reading, and open the output file for writing. The program
 will then read the input file, one line at a time.
 After each line is read, the line will be printed to the
 screen and a prompt will appear.
